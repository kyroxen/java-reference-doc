# The Competitive Programming Package

_Think algorithmically._

## The Process
 1. Read. The. Question. Again.
 2. Think.
 3. Trace out the Algorithm on pen-paper. Remember, solve as if a human be doing it.
    3.1 Handle average cases.
    3.2 Finally handle edge cases.
 4. Dry Run - normal case + edge 
 4. Write code.
 5. Review code.
 6. Run test cases.
 
## Remember
0. _Strength Before Weakness, Journey Before Destination._

1. If a question is new: Brute force if nothing else comes to mind. Something is better than nothing. But remember, anyone can think of a brute force solution. Usually. 

2. Think of optimization, time complexity after brute force.
   
3. If a questions seems familiar / I have solved before: Be extra careful, a trick condition might have been overlooked while reading the question, go a little slow.
